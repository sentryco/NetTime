/**
 * Class which will provide the best estimate of the difference in time between the device's system clock and the time returned by a collection of time servers
 * - Description: This class estimates the time difference between the
 *                device's system clock and the time returned by a collection of time
 *                servers. It helps to synchronize the device's time with the server
 *                time, ensuring accurate timekeeping regardless of the user's local
 *                settings.
 * - Note: This class has Unit-tests
 * - Fixme: ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è If you want to sync your time to a specific server (e.g. your API server)
 * - Fixme: ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è If for some reason the Date format your HTTP Server returns is different than the one specified
 * ## Examples:
 *  Date.updateTime { // Call when app launches etc
 *     print("‚òÄÔ∏è Current Date: \(Date().formatted())")
 *     print("‚òéÔ∏è Server time: \(Date.serverTime.formatted())")
 *  }
